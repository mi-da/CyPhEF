# What is CyPhEF?
CyPhEF is a Model-Driven Engineering framework supporting the development and validation of self-adaptive cyber-physical systems. CyPhEF is implemented as an Eclipse plugin, and is based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework and the Graphical Modeling Project.

# Why CyPhEF?
Self-adaptation is nowadays recognized as an effective
approach to manage the complexity and dynamics inherent
to cyber-physical systems, which are composed of deeply intertwined
physical and software components interacting with each
other. A self-adaptive system typically consists of a managed
subsystem and a managing subsystem that implements the
adaptation logic by means of the well established MAPE-K model,
with Monitor, Analyze, Plan and Execute components, plus a
Knowledge that maintains relevant information for the other
components. Since in large distributed settings a single loop is
hardly adequate to manage the whole system, self-adaptation
is achieved by multiple loops that coordinate with one another.
Developing such systems is challenging, as several dimensions
concerning both the cyber-physical system and the decentralized
control loops should be considered. To this end, we promote
MAPE-K components as first-class modeling abstractions and
provide a framework supporting the design, development, and
validation of decentralized self-adaptive cyber-physical systems.

# Formal Specification
Constraints on the metamodel and on the provided control patterns are defined in Object Constraint Language (OCL), a
declarative language for describing rules applying to UML models. In the following text you can find the whole formal specification

## OCL Rules
You can find the full specification of the OCL rules at the following [link](
